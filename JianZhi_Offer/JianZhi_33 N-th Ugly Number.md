# JianZhi_33 - N-th Ugly Number

## Others' idea 1
DP. All ugly numbers are generated by previous ugly number time 2 or 3 or 5. The key is to generate them in ascending order. To do that we can use three help index p2, p3, p5 and they satisfy these conditions: p2 th ugly number * 2 is bigger than current largest generated ugly number, while (p2-1) th ugly number * 2 is no larger than current largest generated ugly number. The same for p3 and p5. So that each time we choose the min in (dp[p2]\*2,dp[p3]\*3,dp[p5]\*5) as the next ugly number. This can guarantee that it's the smallest one in those larger than current biggest ugly number.

```python
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp=[0]*n
        dp[0]=1
        p2,p3,p5=0,0,0
        for i in range(1,n):
            dp[i]=min(dp[p2]*2,dp[p3]*3,dp[p5]*5)
            if dp[i]>=dp[p2]*2:
                p2+=1
            if dp[i]>=dp[p3]*3:
                p3+=1
            if dp[i]>=dp[p5]*5:
                p5+=1
        return dp[-1]
